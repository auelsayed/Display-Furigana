# Display Furigana
Chrome extension that displays furigana for kanji to make reading and comprehension easier. Probably won't publish on the
Chrome extensions store unless it gets to a more solid point.
Built with the JavaScript port of Kuromoji found at https://github.com/takuyaa/kuromoji.js and the Kuroshiro library found at 
https://github.com/hexenq/kuroshiro. Some functions are credited to various stackoverflow threads but I would like to
specifically credit Kuromojin wrapper of Kuromoji found at https://github.com/azu/kuromojin.
There are many cases of wrong readings provided and kanji that show no readings at all. This is a limitation
of the readings provided by the kuromoji library and not something I can simply fix at the moment.
